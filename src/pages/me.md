I’m Edoardo. This is my blog, my personal website and *digital notebook*.

Here you can read about my interests, side projects, ideas from programming to fiction writing, or some notes about my travels (very much mountain-centric). My goal is to teach my future self (and remember to the old one), but if you find something worth your time, interesting, or inspiring, I would love to [hear what you think](/contact).

If you wanted to stay up to date, there's also an [RSS feed](/feed).

Thank you for stopping by! 🙏
